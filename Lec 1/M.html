      Shivaji I (Shivaji Shahaji Bhosale; Marathi pronunciation: [ʃiʋaːd͡ʒiˑ
      bʱoˑs(ə)leˑ]; c. 19 February 1630 – 3 April 1680[5]), also referred to as
      Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, was an Indian ruler and a member of the
      Bhonsle Maratha clan.[6] Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom
      from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur which formed the genesis
      of the Maratha Empire. In 1674, he was formally crowned the Chhatrapati of
      his realm at Raigad Fort.[7] Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged
      in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire, the Sultanate of
      Golkonda, Sultanate of Bijapur and the European colonial powers. Shivaji's
      military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and
      building forts, and forming a Maratha navy. Shivaji established a
      competent and progressive civil rule with well-structured administrative
      organisations. He revived ancient Hindu political traditions, court
      conventions and promoted the usage of the Marathi and Sanskrit languages,
      replacing Persian in court and administration.[7][8] Shivaji's legacy was
      to vary by observer and time, but nearly two centuries after his death, he
      began to take on increased importance with the emergence of the Indian
      independence movement, as many Indian nationalists elevated him as a
      proto-nationalist and hero of the Hindus.[9][10]

      Sambhaji (Sambhaji Bhonsle; Marathi pronunciation: [saːmbʱaːd͡ʒiˑ
      bʱoˑs(ə)leˑ]; c.14 May 1657 – 11 March 1689) or Chhattrapati Sambhaji
      Maharaj, also referred to as Shambhuraje was the second Chhatrapati of the
      Maratha Empire, ruling from 1681 to 1689. He was the eldest son of
      Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha Empire. Sambhaji's rule was largely
      shaped by the ongoing wars between the Maratha Empire and the Mughal
      Empire, as well as other neighbouring powers such as the Abyssinians of
      Janjira, Wadiyars of Mysore and the Portuguese Empire in Goa. After
      Sambhaji's death, his brother Rajaram I succeeded him as the next
      Chhatrapati and continued the Mughal–Maratha Wars.[1]
