          Shivaji I (Shivaji Shahaji Bhosale; Marathi pronunciation: [ʃiʋaːd͡ʒiˑ
          bʱoˑs(ə)leˑ]; c. 19 February 1630 – 3 April 1680[5]), also referred to
          as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, was an Indian ruler and a member of
          the Bhonsle Maratha clan.[6] Shivaji carved out his own independent
          kingdom from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur which formed
          the genesis of the Maratha Empire. In 1674, he was formally crowned
          the Chhatrapati of his realm at Raigad Fort.[7] Over the course of his
          life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the
          Mughal Empire, the Sultanate of Golkonda, Sultanate of Bijapur and the
          European colonial powers. Shivaji used the difficult terrain of
          Western Ghats to his advantage. He captured and built new Hill Forts
          in Sahyadri Mountain range which proved very difficult for invading
          forces to capture, particularly Mughal armies. Shivaji perfected and
          used Guerilla Warfare to great success against much larger armies of
          Mughals and Deccan Sultanates. Shivaji built a formidable Navy which
          kept English Navy in check. Shivaji's exploits and potential of
          Maratha nation threatened Mughals so much that Mughal Emperor
          Aurangzib started a campaign to conquer Marathas shortly after
          Shivaji's Death [8]. This campaign, better known as Mughal–Maratha
          Wars, was a strategic defeat for Mughals. Aurangzeb failed to crush
          Marathas, and this campaign had a ruinous effect on Mughal Treasury
          and Army [9]. Shortly after Aurangzeb's death, Marathas marched
          northwards, and soon confined Mughals to city of Delhi [10]. Shivaji
          established a competent and progressive civil rule with
          well-structured administrative organisations. He revived ancient Hindu
          political traditions, court conventions and promoted the usage of the
          Marathi and Sanskrit languages, replacing Persian in court and
          administration.[7][11] Praised for his chivalrous treatment of Women
          by his enemies, Shivaji employed people of all castes in his
          administration and army. Shivaji's legacy has varied by observer and
          time. Contemporary English, French, Dutch, Portugese, and Italian
          writers praised his exploits and stratagems. Mughal depictions of
          Shivaji were mostly negative, although most authors praised his
          chivalrous treatment of women. At the beginning of the Indian
          independence movement, Indian nationalists elevated him as a
          proto-nationalist and hero of the Hindus.[12][13] Bal Gangadhra Tilak
          painted him as a "opponent of the oppressor". For Jyotirao Phule, he
          was a hero of Shudras.
